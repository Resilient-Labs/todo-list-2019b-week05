# Todo List

This is a basic todo list. You can enter items into a text field and keep track of them in the form of a list. 

<!--With it, you can enter information, it will be logged on a list, items can be crossed off and a count list will appear to help you keep track of remaining things todo. There is also an option to clear the list to start fresh. -->

## Features

- Features a text input area to jot down individual items.
- 2 easy to read buttons that can be clicked to preform the functions of either adding items to list or clearing the entire list.
- an area to view items added to the list, and an one more area to view remaining items to do.
- I added in an event listeners to the li where the items appear. Upon click the item will toggle to being 'crossed off' and the counter of remaining to do items will update to remove 1 item off of the list.
