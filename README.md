Lesson Learned:

This is one of my first html css projects. To this project I learned that you can create a to do list without using the form type checkboxes. With event listeners you can complete many tasks and even add css and html elements on the javascript page by addElement.  

Example:
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4

```
