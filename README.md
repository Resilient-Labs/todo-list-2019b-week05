# ‚úçüèæ To Do List üìã

This project required some research of properties and methods that I had not used prior, but all the more I learned through it! I wanted to keep it simple, yet effective! As I learn more about OOP, I plan to redo the todo list from scratch. Would love some feedback!

## How Its Made 

**Languages used:** Html, CSS, Javascript

# What I Learned

I learned how to create elements using the DOM and target them to manipulate how they behave.
I also learned how to use functions/methods, such as the `ForEach`, to target each list item separately. 
I researched and learned more about `createElement`, `textContent`, `appendChild` to name a few. Excited to see whats next and how I can improve this and future projects!
